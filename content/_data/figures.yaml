    caption: "There are different ways of getting a ukelele. You can buy one from a store like the one on the left from [Guitar Center](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Kala/Satin-Mahogany-Soprano-Ukulele-1394721681095.gc). Or, you can make one yourself, like the one on the right from [KiwiCo](https://www.kiwico.com/us/store/dp/wooden-ukulele/6553). The KiwiCo version is more work, but it also gives more opportunity for customization, and a better understanding of what a ukelele is and how it works."
    alt: "Two ukeleles on a plain orange background, but the one on the right is made from a kit, and the pieces from the kit are spread out individually below and in front of the finished model."
