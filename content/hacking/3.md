One of the highlights of any visit to the Getty Center is a stroll through the [Central Garden](https://www.getty.edu/news/spend-a-year-in-gettys-garden/). The garden was designed by artist Robert Irwin and is an accessioned artwork in the Museum collection. Here, a sequence of images take us on a walk down part of the path, allowing those on *virtual* visits to have some of the garden experience as well.
