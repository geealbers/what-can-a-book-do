Even flat objects exist in three dimensions and can benefit from animated image sequences. Being able to see and control the turning of this [stereoscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscope) card not only offers an engaging way of seeing the back side, it also gives us a more visceral sense of the size and tactility of the object. More so that we get with even a very nicely designed collection presentation of {% ref fig='stereoscope-static' text='flat images and written dimensions' %}.
