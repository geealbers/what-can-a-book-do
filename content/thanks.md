Thanks for attending my virtual poster session. I hope you enjoyed it and maybe feel inspired to do some of your own feature hacking. I welcome your questions and comments, and am also always happy to talk about digital publishing in general, so please don’t hesitate to reach out.

I previously presented a poster for the ARLIS/NA conference in Minneapolis way back in 2011. It was called “[E-books in the Visual Arts](https://geealbers.net/ebooks-in-the-arts/)” and for it I created a comparison chart of different e-reading devices and then also brought in the devices themselves so attendees could try them out.

The following year, I spoke as part of a panel at the 2012 ARLIS/NA conference in Toronto. My presentation, “[Art Publishers, Artists and E-books](https://geealbers.net/art-publishers-artists-ebooks/),” was an overview of art publishing activities in EPUB, App, Web, and PDF formats. In lieu of slides I created and presented from an EPUB e-book.
