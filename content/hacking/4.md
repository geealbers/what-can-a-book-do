Work to [conserve Roy Lichtenstein’s *Three Brushstrokes*](https://www.getty.edu/news/conserving-lichtensteins-three-brushstrokes/) began in the early 2000s and was completed in 2011. The painstaking repainting process was captured in a timelapse video. Here users can use the image sequence viewer to scrub back and forth through time, painting an unpainting the sculpture.
