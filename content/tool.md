The digital tool this poster was built with is called [Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/). Quire is a free and open-source publishing tool developed at Getty. We designed it especially to help users create scholarly, visually rich publications. Focusing on discoverability and longevity, Quire can output a book as a website, a PDF, and an EPUB e-book all from the same set of source files. It can also include deep zooming images, audio and video, image overlays, and more.

Quire is full of powerful features but its plain text interface can be daunting to new users.

When they get used to working in a text editor, many users appreciated the high degree of control it gives them over their book. Being exposed to the pieces of books, means it is easier to manipulate them. This can be done in simple ways, like changing a color or reorganizing a page; or in more complex ways like creating a new interactive feature or restructuring the navigation.

Since releasing Quire as free software (first in a private beta in 2018 and then under a full open-source license in 2022), dozens of institutions have used Quire to create books, journals, online exhibitions, and more. You can find some of them in our [Community Showcase](https://quire.getty.edu/community/community-showcase/).
