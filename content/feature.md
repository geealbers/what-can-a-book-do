Last year, we added a feature to Quire that allows users to include 360-degree rotating images in their books. In the context of an art collection catalogue, figures like these add visual excitement and give scholars the most possible views for study. The feature takes full advantage of digital publishingâ€™s affordances and we are no longer limited to showing only front, back, and side view images for sculptural objects.

Prior to working on this feature, I didn't know how these rotating figures were made. I assumed they were 3D scans of some sort. As it turns out, however, while some 360-degree images may indeed be scans (which you can rotate on *any* axis), the ones we use (which rotate on only *one* axis) are sequences of static images.

{% figure 'sequence-images' %}

Instead of taking only a handful of images of the object, our photographers take 360 images, one for each degree of rotation. To view them as a rotating object, a script runs to show and hide those images one at a time, in very quick succession, as a reader click and drags across the screen. The resulting animation creates the illusion of a three-dimensional object. 

If we consider this new feature not as one that specifically displays 360-degree object views, but rather as one that can more generically scroll quickly through groups of *any* images, what other kinds of image sequences might we imagine.
