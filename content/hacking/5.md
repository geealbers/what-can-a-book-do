A rotating sandwich, inspired by my lunch at the Getty Cafe and [rotatingsandwiches.com](https://rotatingsandwiches.com/), winner of the [2023 Tiny Award.](https://tinyawards.net/2023/) This is a 360-degree sequence like the ones we use for collection catalogues, but made in a low-fi DIY manner. Hacking the production more than the outcome.
